The following are instructions to play Space Ace completely free on Daphne Laserdisc emulator. I had trouble myself finding all the files to run it, and what to do online. So, I thought I would share how I figured
everything out.

1. Download Daphne at: http://www.daphne-emu.com/site3/index_hi.php . It is a great laserdisc emulator which allows you to play many laserdisc arcade games like Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair 2,
and Space Ace.
2. Extract Daphne to C:\ drive (if you do not put it here, you will need to edit the batch file I have supplied with this folder)
3. Rename the daphne folder in the C:\ drive from "daphne-1.0v-win32" to simply just "daphne" (Some of you may realize this isn't entirely necessary, but just bear with me, it's just the 
way I set it up, and this way you don't need to re-write stuff)
4. Extract "ace.zip" to C:\daphne\roms . C:\daphne\roms . Make sure the files are just under the one sub folder in roms (eg. C:\daphne\roms\ace\)
5. You will need the text document in this file labelled "ace.txt" included in this folder. Place this file under C:\daphne\framefile\
6. Download "SPACEACEFRAME.rar" from: http://www.filedropper.com/spaceaceframe
7. Extract "SPACEACEFRAME.rar" to C:\daphne\
8. Finally, take "ace.bat", and place it under C:\daphne\
9. Now run "ace.bat". Space Ace should be working.

Tips:
	- It will take a little to boot up, so be patient
	- Once it runs through all the way to the intro scene, you can start. Press "6" to insert coin, and press "1" to start.
	- I recommend using a controller of some sort, makes for a better experience I find


Have fun!
